# Study-group-2

## Description 

Interest in stocks has gain mainstream popularity recently thanks to the subreddit WallStreetBets, the scandal circulating around Robinhood,  and the uncertainty of market volatility. Stocks have peaked the interests of both young and old inexperienced but curious investors. We offer a solution with simplicity in mind. 

We are not financial advisors, we are The Brokers. 

A group of four young developers created an application that allows the user to gain instant information regarding a stock with relevant news information. We believe the user should have all the available information in one simple application to make their own informed financial decision. 

We wanted to create an applcation that will allow prospective investors to have all the tools readily available to make their own informed stock investment decisions.

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
