## Description 

Interest in stocks has gain mainstream popularity recently thanks to the subreddit WallStreetBets, the scandal circulating around Robinhood,  and the uncertainty of market volatility. Stocks have peaked the interests of both young and old inexperienced but curious investors. We offer a solution with simplicity in mind. 

We are not financial advisors, we are The Brokers. 

A group of four young developers created an application that allows the user to gain instant information regarding a stock with relevant news information. We believe the user should have all the available information in one simple application to make their own informed financial decision. 

We wanted to create an applcation that will allow prospective investors to have all the tools readily available to make their own informed stock investment decisions.

Upon entering the stock ticker you will be shown relevant stock information, as well as prior opening and closing prices of the stock in one hour intervals:

![alt text](./assets/images/start.png "Snapshot of opening and closing prices of stock by the hour!")

Hovering over a stock price will make the text pop out and allow for easier readability

Simply clicking on the article will open up the article in a seperate tab for you to read more in depth about the stock!

![alt text](./assets/images/preview.png "Get more in depth information before investing!")

As you search for more and more stocks, a list of your recently searched stocks will be displayed for easy access!

![alt text](./assets/images/save.png "Build a small watchlist of stocks!")

As you build your stock watchlist, clicking on one of the saved stocks will display current stock information and news articles so you're always up to date!

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
