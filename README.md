# The Brokers

## Description 

Interest in stocks has gain mainstream popularity recently thanks to the subreddit WallStreetBets, the scandal circulating around Robinhood,  and the uncertainty of market volatility. Stocks have peaked the interests of both young and old inexperienced but curious investors. We offer a solution with simplicity in mind. 

We are not financial advisors, we are The Brokers. 

A group of four young developers created an application that allows the user to gain instant information regarding a stock with relevant news information. We believe the user should have all the available information in one simple application to make their own informed financial decision. 

We wanted to create an applcation that will allow prospective investors to have all the tools readily available to make their own informed stock investment decisions.
